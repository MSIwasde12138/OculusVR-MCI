scripts including tasks of cognitive training
These codes are used to implement certain functions of VR cognitive tasks, they do not work alone and require instances of specific components of your VR project.
Instances can be created and applied on your own based on the classes in the code.
AwardSystem.cs is used for recognition of correct or incorrect object classification in the task, and task time recognition, based on which the task progress is represented on the UI.
NetPlayerControl.cs is used to build a multiplayer networking framework, which enables movement in multiplayer mode, and indoor collision detection.
ServerChoose.cs is used for selecting the server.
Singsongs.cs is used for controlling the music playback in relaxed scenarios.
SquareCollect.cs and WeaponCollect.cs are used for the recognition of both objects of the classification task, and the recognition is based on collision detection.
TaskTip.cs is used to control the UI display in the task.
TimeTip.cs is used to control and display the remaining end time of the task and stop the task.
UIData.cs is used to collect the score in the wayfinding task and display it in the UI display.
datacollecter.cs is used to output the score and store it in the workstation.
moviecontroller.cs is used to play the normal video and the panoramic video in the relaxation scenario.
